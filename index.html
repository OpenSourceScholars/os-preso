	    MIT Hacker community late 70's early 80's.
	    Stallman at this time is working in the AI Lab at MIT with
	    a bunch of other "hackers". It's important to note that
	    the community of people working at the lab freely modified
	    and traded programs with their source code.

	  <aside class="notes">
	    This giant state of the art monolith was a gift from the
	    Xerox corporation. This was their first networked printer
	    which came with a boatload of new problems.

	    Prior to their receiving this gift, they had another
	    printer which they had a lot of problems with. Stallman
	    had written some code on their PDP-11 which would let
	    people know that the printer had become jammed and then
	    two to three people in the lab would come check it out and
	    at least one of them would be able to fix it. But they
	    didn't have the source code for this printer and wanted to
	    make similar modifications.

	    He then heard of a guy over at Carnegie Mellon who had
	    recently left a job at Xerox and had the source code that
	    they so desperately needed. And the man told Stallman that
	    he had "promised not to give him a copy". Because of an NDA.

	    This made Stallman extremely angry. So much so that he

	    Linus Torvalds, a Finnish graduate student would use the

	    named the whole package Linux (Linus+Unix). Wasn't his

	    Eric S Raymond, unnofficial spokesman for the Open Source
	    Movement. Got his start in closed source software
	    development in the 80's and then became the maintainer of

	  <aside class="notes">
	    Discusses the Cathedral approach to software development
	    vs. the Bazaar. In the Cathedral the code is handed down
	    to you from above, hunting for bugs in a closed system is
	    difficult because only a few developers have access to the
	    code to begin with.

	    In the Bazaar, where everyone is freely trading/working on
	    code, bugs are found quickly.

	    Defends the right for developers to close source if they
	    want to but talks about the benefits of open source.

	  <aside class="notes">
	    Using the Bazaar approach to software development, any bug
	    becomes trivial with enough people looking at it because
	    it's open to the public's testing and scrutiny. Also goes
	    on to state that the logic of a closed source system puts
	    developers into dysfunctional roles that generate bad
	    results.

	    Netscape references the Cathedral and the Bazaar in their
	    white paper that led to the release of the Netscape source
	    code.

	    Doesn't really work out and Netscape basically just
	    rewrites the whole thing but they've come a long way since

	  <h2>The Open Source Initiative</h2>

	  <aside class="notes">
	    Co-founded by Eric S Raymond in 1998 following the open
	    sourcing of Netscape. Created separately from the FSF to
	    "dump the moralizing and confrontational attitude that had
	    been associated with 'free software' in the past and sell
	    the idea strictly on the same pragmatic, business-case
	    grounds that had motivated Netscape." Michael Tiemann

	    The focus of OSI is on marketing, which Stallman says
	    ignored the "ethical imperative" of free software.
