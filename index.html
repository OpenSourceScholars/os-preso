	    MIT Hacker community late 70's early 80's.
	    Stallman at this time is working in the AI Lab at MIT with
	    a bunch of other "hackers". It's important to note that
	    the community of people working at the lab freely modified
	    and traded programs with their source code.

	    This giant state of the art monolith was a gift from the
	    Xerox corporation. This was their first networked printer
	    which came with a boatload of new problems.

	    Prior to their receiving this gift, they had another
	    printer which they had a lot of problems with. Stallman
	    had written some code on their PDP-11 which would let
	    people know that the printer had become jammed and then
	    two to three people in the lab would come check it out and
	    at least one of them would be able to fix it. But they
	    didn't have the source code for this printer and wanted to
	    make similar modifications.

	    He then heard of a guy over at Carnegie Mellon who had
	    recently left a job at Xerox and had the source code that
	    they so desperately needed. And the man told Stallman that
	    he had "promised not to give him a copy". Because of an NDA.

	    Linus Torvalds, a Finnish graduate student would use the

	    named the whole package Linux (Linus+Unix). Wasn't his

	  <aside class="notes">
	    Eric S Raymond, unnofficial spokesman for the Open Source
	    Movement. Got his start in closed source software
	    development in the 80's and then became the maintainer of
	    many open source projects such as fetchmail (which he no
	    longer maintains).

	    Discusses the Cathedral approach to software development
	    vs. the Bazaar. In the Cathedral the code is handed down
	    to you from above, hunting for bugs in a closed system is
	    difficult because only a few developers have access to the
	    code to begin with.

	    Before the Linux Kernel, ESR thought that something so
	    low-level/complicated as a kernel had to be created by a
	    group of wizards with apriori knowledge, working in a
	    quiet cathedral.

	    In the Bazaar, where everyone is freely trading/working on
	    code, bugs are found quickly.

	  <aside class="notes">
	    Using the Bazaar approach to software development, any bug
	    becomes trivial with enough people looking at it because
	    it's open to the public's testing and scrutiny.

	    The idea ESR is trying to get across is that open source
	    software is more resilient, written faster, and comes
	    cheaper than its closed source counterparts.

	    Major event in Open Source history - 1998 release of
	    Mozilla (then Netscape) Communicator 4.5. Eric Hahn of
	    Netscape references the Cathedral and the Bazaar in their
	    white paper that led to the release of the Netscape source
	    code.

	    This was a chance for Open Source to prove itself to the
	    rest of the world. ESR basically said, if this doesn't
	    work the corporate world isn't going to try this again for
	    another 10 years...

	    Doesn't really work out and Netscape basically just
	    rewrites the whole thing but they've come a long way since
	    then.

	    Co-founded by Eric S Raymond in 1998 following the open

	    the idea strictly on the same pragmatic, business-case
	    grounds that had motivated Netscape." Michael Tiemann

	    It's super important to keep practicing at this sort of
	    thing. Tim and I will get an idea for something and stay
	    up til 4 am working on it when we don't even think it will
	    see the light of day. Some of the things we write that way
	    do get used at Red Hat but you have to write some throw
	    away code sometimes. Make up a project for fun. If you're
	    entrenched in the open source world, contributions will
	    come to you easily.
